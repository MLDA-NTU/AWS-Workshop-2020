    "## Background\n",
    "**Model**: Ever heard about *Generative Adversarial Model* (GAN) ? How about *DeepFakes*? Many generative models nowadays use typical GAN architecture to model data distribution, then reconstruct and generate a completely new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen many application of GAN such as face generation and face morphing. The underlying model behind GAN architecture that enables its generative capability is called *Variational Autoencoder* (VAE). Today we are going to take a look on how to build a simple Conditional VAE model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset**: MNIST is a widely used dataset for handwritten digit classification. It consists of 70,000 labeled 28x28 pixel grayscale images of hand-written digits. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. There are 10 classes (one for each of the 10 digits).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "This tutorial will show you how to build and deploy on Sagemaker using Pytorch. The dataset we are using is the MNIST dataset. To get the feel, we will first see how a simple neural network can be used to generate a new handwritten digit image without human intervension. Then we will train and deploy our Pytorch model in Sagemaker environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about the PyTorch in SageMaker, please visit [sagemaker-pytorch-containers](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-pytorch-containers) and [sagemaker-python-sdk](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk) github repositories.\n",
